# LoginForm-NodeJS-Server
Here i've created a NodeJS Web server on my Local Windows machine that demonstrates the Sign-up/Sign-in functionalities of a Web Page developed using HTML/CSS/JS.
I've used MySql version 8.0.35 for all the database applications includes storing the data inputs on succesful signup and authentication while a user signs himself in.
I'm including the index.html and app.js in the repo.
